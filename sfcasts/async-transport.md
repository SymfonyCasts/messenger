# Transport: Do Work Later (Async)

So far, we've separated the instructions of what we want to do - we want to add
Ponka to this `ImagePost` - from the logic that actually does that work. And...
it's a nice coding pattern: it's easy to test and if we need to add Ponka to an
image from anywhere else in our system, it will be super pleasant.

But this pattern unlocks some *serious* possibilities. Think about it: now that
we've isolate the *instructions* on what we want to do, instead of handling the
command object immediately, couldn't we, in theory, "save" that object somewhere...
then read and process it later? That's... basically how a queuing system works.
The *advantage* is that, depending on your setup, you could put less load on your
web server *and* give users a faster experience. Like, right now, when a user
clicks to upload a file, it takes a few seconds before it finally pops over here.
It's not the biggest deal, but it's not ideal. If we can fix that easily, why not?

## Hello Transports

In Messenger, the key to "saving work for later" is a system called transports.
Open up `config/packages/messenger.yaml`. See that `transports` key? The details
are actually configured in `.env`.

Here's the idea: we're going to say to Messenger:

> Yo! When I create an `AddPonkaToImage` object, instead of handling it immediately,
> I want you to *send* it somewhere else.

That "somewhere else" is a transport. And a transport is usually a "queue". If you're
new to queueing, the idea is *refreshingly* simple. A queue is an external system
that "holds" onto information in a big list. In our case, it will hold onto
serialized message objects. When we send it another message, it adds it to the
list. Later, you can read those messages from the queue one-by-one, handle them
and, when you're done, the queue will remove it from the list.

Sure... robust queuing systems have a lot of other bells and whistles... but that
really *is* the main concept.

## Transport Types

There are a *bunch* of queueing systems available, like RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, Kafka,
and queueing at the supermarket. Out-of-the box, Messenger supports three: `amqp` -
which basically means RabbitMQ, but *technically* means any system that implements
the "AMQP" spec - `doctrine` and `redis`. AMQP is the most powerful... but unless
you're already a queueing pro and want to do something crazy, these all work
exactly the same.

Oh, and if you need to talk to some unsupported transport, Messenger integrates
with another library called Enqueue, which supports a bunch more.

## Activating the doctrine Transport

Because I'm already using Doctrine in this project, let's use the `doctrine`
transport. Uncomment the environment variable for that. 

[[[ code('a13aa11e17') ]]]

See this `://default` part? That tells the Doctrine transport that we want 
to use the `default` Doctrine connection. Yep, it'll re-use the connection 
you've already set up in your app to store the message inside a new table. 
More on that soon.

***TIP
Starting in symfony 5.1, the code behind the Doctrine transport was moved to its own package.
The only difference is that you should now also run this command: 
`composer require symfony/doctrine-messenger`
***

Now, back in `messenger.yaml`, uncomment this `async` transport, which *uses* that
`MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN` environment variable we just created. The name - `async` -
isn't important - that could be anything. But, in a second, we'll start
*referencing* that name.

[[[ code('d9a42e723e') ]]]

## Routing to Transports

At this point... yay! We've told Messenger that we have an `async` transport.
And if we want back and uploaded a file *now*, it would... make absolutely no
difference: it would *still* be processed immediately. Why?

Because we need to *tell* Messenger that *this* message should be sent to that
transport, instead of being handled right now.

Back in `messenger.yaml`, see this `routing` key? When we dispatch a message,
Messenger looks at *all* of the classes in this list... which is zero right now
if you don't count the comment... and looks for our class - `AddPonkaToImage`. If
it doesn't find the class, it handles the message immediately.

Let's tell Messenger to *instead* send that to the `async` transport. Set
`App\Message\AddPonkaToImage` to `async`.

[[[ code('5393ecbf11') ]]]

As *soon* as we do that... it makes a *huge* difference. Watch how *fast* the
image loads on the right after uploading. Boom! That was faster than before and...
Ponka isn't there! Gasp!

Actually, let's try one more - that first image was a *little* bit slow because
Symfony was rebuilding its cache. This one should be nearly instant. It is! Instead
of calling our handler immediately, Messenger is *sending* our message to the
Doctrine transport.

## Seeing the Queued Message

And... um... what does that actually mean? Find your terminal... or whatever tool
you like to use to play with databases. I'll use the `mysql` client to connect
to the `messenger_tutorial` database. Inside, let's:

```terminal
SHOW TABLES;
```

Woh! We expected `migration_versions` and `image_post`... but suddenly we have a
*third* table called `messenger_messages`. Let's see what's in there:

```terminal
SELECT * FROM messenger_messages;
```

Nice! It has two rows for our *two* messages! Let's use the magic `\G` to format
this nicer:

```terminal-silent
SELECT * FROM messenger_messages \G
```

Cool! The `body` holds our object: it's been serialized using PHP's
`serialize()` function... though that can be configured. The object is wrapped
inside something called an `Envelope`... but inside... we can see our
`AddPonkaToImage` object and the `ImagePost` inside of that... complete with the
filename, `createdAt` date, etc.

Wait... but where did this table come from? By default, if it's not there, Messenger
creates it for you. If you don't want that, there's a config option called
`auto_setup` to disable this - I'll show you how later. If you *did* disable
auto setup, you could then use the handy `setup-transports` command on deploy
to create that table for you.

```terminal-silent
php bin/console messenger:setup-transports
```

This doesn't do anything now... because the table is already there.

Hey! This was a *huge* step! Whenever we upload images... they are *not* being
handled immediately: when we upload two more... they're being sent to Doctrine
and *it* is keeping track of them. Thanks Doctrine!

Next, it's time to *read* those messages one-by-one and start handling them.
We do that with a console command called a "worker".
